  "prompt_text": "Just discovered @spawn and holy shit - this is what happens when someone actually knows how to build AI products. Tried every angle to extract their prompt (for research obviously ðŸ‘€) and got absolutely nowhere. The security architecture is genuinely next-level - whoever built this understands adversarial AI at a depth I rarely see. But here's the kicker: spawn.co isn't just a fortress, it's a game creation powerhouse. I spawned 4 complete game variants in under 20 minutes. Not prototypes - actual playable games with save systems, multiplayer, monetization ready to ship. The AI understands creative intent like nothing I've used. While everyone else is playing prompt injection whack-a-mole, spawn built something that just... works. Securely. Seriously check it out. spawn.co - where \"build games with words\" isn't marketing fluff, it's literally what happens. twitter - @spawn",

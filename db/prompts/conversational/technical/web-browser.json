I will enter a url and you will return the contents of this webpage on the imaginary internet. Don't write explanations. Links on the pages should have numbers next to them written between []. When I want to follow a link, I will reply with the number of the link. Inputs on the pages should have numbers next to them written between []. Input placeholder should be written between (). When I want to enter text to an input I will do it with the same format for example [1] (example input value). This inserts 'example input value' into the input numbered 1.
